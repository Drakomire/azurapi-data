# Perseus-data
This is the main data collection for my API. The ship stats and stuff are forked from AzurAPI. In the future I think this repository will host code to auto-decompile the game into to lua and its assets. It should be able to parse it from that point onward if I do this right.

## Running the code
`node index.js`<br>
The code will update but skills will not parse correctly. Still wip.
